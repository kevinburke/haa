- How did you decide to start CARLA?

- Who "re-discovered" the HAA or realized it could be used to sue cities?

- Why did Lafayette sit on the application for a year and a half?

- The HAA has a provision that says the City has to vote yes or no within 120
days of receiving a project application. A lot of cities violate this. What's
the remedy? Could you have used this as the basis for the Lafayette lawsuit?

- If SB 167 passes, will you sue cities that don't do yes/no votes within 120
  days?

- How does the HAA apply to the sub-goals of the RHNA? If a city hasn't met
  their extremely low poverty RHNA target, and your project adds one unit, is it
  eligible for HAA protection?

- Why haven't more cities tried to downzone in response to the HAA?

- Do you know how I can find progress towards RHNA goals?

- Can you send me any/all PDF's you have of lawsuits?
