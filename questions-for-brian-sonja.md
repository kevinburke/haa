- How did you decide to start CARLA?

- Who "re-discovered" the HAA or realized it could be used to sue cities?

- Why did Lafayette sit on the application for a year and a half?

- The HAA has a provision that says the City has to vote yes or no within 120

- If SB 167 passes, will you sue cities that don't do yes/no votes within 120
  days?

- How does the HAA interact with BMR housing/zoning?

- Why haven't more cities tried to downzone in response to the HAA?

- Do you know how I can find city progress towards RHNA goals?

- Can you send me any/all PDF's you have of lawsuits?

- How many violations of the HAA are there statewide per year?
