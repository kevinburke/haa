- How did you decide to start CARLA?

- Who "re-discovered" the HAA or realized it could be used to sue cities?

- If the Planning Commission certified the EIR why was it appealed?

- would it have been better for the case if the city had actually voted to
disapprove the Land Use permit?

- Why don't more cities just fail to certify the EIR, like Lafayette did? What
  is the recourse for EIR appeal if the City Council says no?

- The HAA has a provision that says the City has to vote yes or no within 120
days of receiving a project application. A lot of cities violate this. What's
the remedy? Could you have used this as the basis for the Lafayette lawsuit?

- If SB 167 passes, will you sue cities that don't do yes/no votes within 120
  days?

- How does the HAA interact with BMR housing/zoning?

- Why haven't more cities tried to downzone in response to the HAA?

- Do you know how I can find city progress towards RHNA goals?

- Can you send me any/all PDF's you have of lawsuits?

- How many violations of the HAA are there statewide per year?

- How do you choose which cases to sue over?

- Do you know anything about the history of the law's passing in 1982? I've been
  trying to find data...

- Where or how did you learn about the HAA?

- I'm a little confused reading the Lafayette suit details. The Planning Commission certified the EIR, but it was appealed? Why was it appealed - did the EIR say "you can only put 50 units" here or something?

- If the HAA ties cities hands, why don't more cities contrive to deny EIR's, or use spurious "gentrification" arguments like SF did in approving an EIR appeal recently? If you're a developer is there even an avenue for you to appeal an EIR past the city level?

- Do you think the Lafayette lawsuit would have had a better chance if the developer forced the city to deny a Land Use permit for the original 300 units?

- The HAA specifies that cities must approve or deny applications within 90 days (if the project has a BMR component or state/federal funds), 120 days (if it's mostly housing), 180 days (for part housing, part commercial). Most cities exceed these deadlines. Have you considered suing cities for exceeding these deadlines? "Housing delayed is housing denied," is the refrain I've heard.

- How many housing rejections - HAA-compliant or no - would you estimate there are per year, statewide? (Guessing there is no easy way to tally this)

- Of those, how many or what percent are HAA-eligible? For example, it's my understanding that this project is not eligible for HAA relief if it gets rejected, since it requires a variance. https://t.co/oaY3gAn08n

Thanks for your help! I appreciate it. On my way to Berkeley Law Library today to read more about the law's original passage in 1982.
